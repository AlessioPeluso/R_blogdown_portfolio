Hi,
I'm [Alessio](https://www.instagram.com/alessio.peluso/) and I'm a **Data Scientist** at [**Sixth Sense srl**](https://www.sixth-sense.ai/).

I'm **100%** a **Statistician** and **I love** [**R**](https://www.r-project.org/) and [**Pyhton**](https://www.python.org/).

I'm graduated at the [**University of Florence**](https://www.disia.unifi.it/) both Bachelor Degree and Master Degree in Statistics (<3).

In all my studies I've studied all the theory and practice of the statistical models underneath the *universe* of *machine learning*. 

Hopefully, I'll upload some projects [here](https://alessiopeluso.netlify.app/projects/).
